  {{#scenarios}}
  Scenario: Changing calling point stopping times
    Given a query between "{{origin}}" and "{{destination}}" on "{{originalDate}}" at "{{departureTime}}"
    Then I should see a service "{{tuid}}" that stops at
      | stop | arrival | departure |
      {{#originalStops}}
      | {{stop}}  | {{arrivalTime}}   | {{departureTime}}     |
      {{/originalStops}}
    When I query between "{{origin}}" and "{{destination}}" on "{{overlayDate}}" at "{{departureTime}}"
    Then I should see a service "{{tuid}}" that stops at
      | stop | arrival | departure |
      {{#newStops}}
      | {{stop}}  | {{arrivalTime}}   | {{departureTime}}     |
      {{/newStops}}
