Feature: Journey splits
  Journey planners should treat trains that split as a single journey

  {{#scenarios}}
  Scenario: Train splits so there appears to be a single train between {{origin}} and {{destination}}
    Given a query between "{{origin}}" and "{{destination}}" on "{{date}}" at "{{departureTime}}"
    Then I should see a service "{{tuid}}" that stops at
      | stop | arrival | departure |
      {{#stops}}
      | {{stop}}  | {{arrivalTime}}   | {{departureTime}}     |
      {{/stops}}
