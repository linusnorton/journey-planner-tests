Feature: The journey planner should offer connect services after midnight

#  Scenario: A journey between EUS and MAN should connect at CRE after midnight
#    Given a query between "EUS" and "MAN" on "a weekday" at "22:00"
#    Then I should see the following transfer patterns
#      | EUS, MAN |
#      | EUS, CRE, MAN |
